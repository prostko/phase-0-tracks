\cf0 	-CALCULATE a path to elevators\
	-ORIENT front towards path\
	-NAVIGATE path to elevators, use good navigational practices, avoid collisions\
- IDENTIFY_ELEVATOR \
	IDENTIFY door sill, floor indicator, and input panel\
		IF elevator is in good working condition begin ENTER_ELEVATOR\
		ELSE begin STAIRS\
- ENTER_ELEVATOR	\
	IF you need to go up, THEN depress top button of panel\
		IF you need to go down, THEN depress bottom of panel \
		-UNTIL doors are open, wait until doors open keep pressing button over and over again, it makes the elevator 					go faster.

		IF elevator is occupied, wait 3 seconds \
			THEN \
			IF occupants do not exit, AND space for each occupant is >= 2cu.ft AND load increase is safe\
				-ask if you may enter, wait for response\
				IF affirmative, enter cabin, NAVIGATE towards maximum average personal space allowed,\
			ELSE wait until door closes, restart ENTER_ELEVATOR\
-SELECT_FLOOR\
	-IF address stored on file, FIND floor number\
		ELSEIF search online for address, FIND floor number\
		ELSE Contact operator and ask for input\
	-IDENTIFY input panel\
		IDENTIFY  buttons\
		LOCATE value equal to address \
		DEPRESS button for value\
	-UNTIL (floor level indicator OR aural beep sounds OR internal altimeter == correct floor) && doors are open\
		-wait\
EXIT ELEVATOR\
	-WHEN doors are open\
		IF elevator is occupied, give salutations to occupant(s)\
		ELSE just leave\
	-SEARCH records for floor plan\
	-CALCULATE path to destination\
	-ORIENT\
	-NAVIGATE\
	WHEN arrived successfully at destination, store directions for future use\
