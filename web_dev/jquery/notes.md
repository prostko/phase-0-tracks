## Study plan for JQuery
### 2 hours
### Using a pomodoro timer as red light / green light

1. Find JQuery Docs
2. Download, set-up or intialize JQuery
3. Find a (few) pages on how to learn JQuery
4. Find a cheatsheet for JQuery, skim
5. Find a useful video/ tutorial for JQuery
6. Try to find situations to use it, or possibly a practice site.
7. Implement it in a VPS maybe or just locally. 
8. Figure out a project to use it, implement that project, Fight though and figure it out

This has generally been the approach I've used for other things, SQL, JS, CSS and this is how I've generally
been successful. I try to figure out what the thing is, then I try to figure out what I don't know. Then I try
to fill in those gaps, pretty much in order to find out more of what I don't know. Then repeat. 
The pomodor timer is the thing that i like to use the most, for whatever reason my brain tends to remember things
better if i use the pomodoro. This exercise should alst about 4 tomatos. After which will be a long break anyway.
