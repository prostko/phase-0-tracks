###LINUX (and UNIX)

LINUX is a lightweight operating system that is easily run on a lot of various system architectures. It isn’t necessarily the MOST stable or flexible in terms of hardware, but it can be easily used in a lot of places. 
    It is designed to be used by the ‘computer literate’ it will just run the commands that you ask of it. It will run or do anything that you ask of it. Some guy (who may or may not actually exist) said: “Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.” Linux was kind of based on the UNIX operating system,but is totally open source. 



###VPS
    A virtual private server is some (super cheap) memory that is somewhere in some server that you can ask to make into a server just for you. It will have (depending) a LINUX operating system that you can load files into and do whatever you want with. It will be a fully functioning website server, albeit ’not very robust’. Here you can destroy root directories without care, because you can always just redownload it. Its like a sandbox computer. 
    This can be used to run a server somewhere other than your house, or wherever, and is  a lot cheaper -short term- than actually buying a dedicated machine or server box yourself. 

###Root User
    There seems to be a lot of contention on this one, but not on the original issue itself. It seems that a root user can do anything they want to, destroy the kernel for instance, and nothing will stop them. A regular user can do this too, but they need a password.  Also, when on root, all of your programs are running as root as well. So your dumb music player can wipe your system by accident. Its also a security risk for this reason as well.
