# Encrypt

	# Make the Loop
	
		#-index set to 0, to start loop from the beginning of the word
	
		#-in order to encrypt, first give the method a name
	
		#-find the length with built-in method [.length]
		
		#-using length of the word given to us by .length the method will know how many times to loop through
	
		#-make index break point = to .length
	
	# Encrypt the password

		#-add on .next to method_name so that every letter advances to next letter in the sequence of the alphabet
	
		#-use variable_password[index] connected with .next to complete the method
	
		#-close out loop


# Decrypt

	# Make the Loop
	
		#-put index set as "abc...xyz"

		#-give method name: decrypt

		#-find length of word with .length
	
		#-use length of the word to give condition to the loop how many times to cycle through password


	# Decrypt the password

		#-Revert the word to normal by making a loop that goes through the word using the index 

		#-using the index[alphabet] find position of each letter in the password and subtact one from that index[position] once 
	
		#-take that new letter referenced by the index and insert it into the password index position
