	<p><em>This is a portrait taken of my great grandfather that was featured in the local newspaper.</em></p>

	<p>My wife and I recently aquired an espresso machine at a flea market, and it's straight bum, yo. There are all kinds of things you can make with it.
	<ul>
		<li>Coffee, sometimes even as good as Starbucks</li>
		<li>Hot water</li>
		<li>Steamed Eggs</li>
		<li>Your in-laws impressed by your off-handed well-roundedness and nonchalant sophistication</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are several places in DC that are good for studying. Here's a few of the best. (srs)</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The atrium inside the Smithsoniam National Portrait Gallery</li>
		<li>The National Rose Garden, zero wifi however</li>
		<li>The loft inside the <a href="http://www.compasscoffee.com/">Compass Coffee </a> near Howard University</li>
		<li>The National Library</li>
		<li>The Starbucks outside the <a href="http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/home/#collection=home">Hirschhorn Museum of Modern Art and Sculpture Garden.</a> Highly Reccommend the museum as well. Though not as good archetecturally as the Richmond Museum of Modern Art, still visually quite riveting.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>And, you have my sincere apology, because that's the end of the greatest minimalist website you've ever seen. </p>
