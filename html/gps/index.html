		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Html5 tags are used for making an HTML document more semantic, which is readable and understandable. It clarifies the intent of the html. I see sections being very useful in order make the styling more organized. To help keep it all structured. Figure is also a good one, encountered that one in documentation, but that seems like a nice way of handling the images in a page. Also Aside. The documentation uses that as a place for all the additional ads on a page, and I see that structure a lot when I'm looking at other websites. I also see fixed link bars on the sides of pages quite a bit. </li>
			<li>The Browser looks for the semantic improtance of the content. So it will look for body, then header, main, or footer, then inside those, for h1, h2, h3, article, p, whatever. From root upwards.</li>
			<li>Sublime is handy. I've seen a lot of sites that are just huge assignment lists and aliases that are used in bash, and its cool that sublime can do that too. It will make coding much more fun and way faster.</li>
			<li>I felt that looking at the snippet code at first was very confusing. It just seemed crazy and out of reach, but slowing down and focusing on the details, and researching was the way through it.</li>
