		<h3>Legislative Shutdown Imminant</h3>
		<p> As of February 30th, the legislative body of the government will cease to be funded, and will shut down. The entire Senate and House will be on a self-granted vacation, due to the fact that neither can come to agreement on the polarizing "Grinch Bill", establishing christmas trees are either legal or not. The case is expected to go to the Supreme Court, which itself is embroiled in the possibly landmark decision of re-labeling "illegal aliens" "contra-judicial individuals".</p>
