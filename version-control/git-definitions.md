# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.
--
* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	> Version control is the organization of multiple steps of code making. Initial code, then saving this, creating a clone to expiriment with, saving that as a step and merging the two to become one, all while having the ability to understand the logic behind each of the steps and revert back to any of the previous steps. It gives order and flow to the changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	> A branch is the name for the clone that a programmer would make to add changes and expiriment with, so (s)he could have the ability to work out changes and kinks without messing up the actual master code itself, then communicate reasoning behind the changes, get it reviewed, and then finally, merge the new improved features or implimentations into the master. Safe work enviroment, explanation, and proofreading ability are why you would use a branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	> A commit is saving the new branch and adding it to the master. It creates a reversable point and the ability to leave a reasonable, clear message as to what the change is, so others can understand what's going on inside. It also leaves a timestamp.

* What is a merge conflict?
	Merge conflict occurs when there seems to be a fundamental difference in the two files to be merged. Usually when there have been changes made to both branches (maybe to the same line of code). This would require the two to come together and figure out the issue themselves, instead of Git being able to figure it out for them.
